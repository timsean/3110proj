welcomes you warmly and offers you a seat. As you sit, you notice a sign that
says \"Think\" toward your right, so you ruminate on what question to ask him.
After what seems to be an eternity of silence, you home in on the perfect
question: \"Why do you love functional programming?\"

Prof. Clarkson smiles, takes a deep breath, and starts: \"That's a great
question! To answer that, we'll have to go all the way back to the beginning.
In the 1930's, Alonzo Church formulated what we now know as untyped lambda
calculus...\"

As you absorb all this information, you feel as if spacetime is distorting
around you and this office.

\"...so that's why functional programming is so great,\" Prof. Clarkson concludes.
You can't shake the feeling that you've been transported through a wormhole
somehow, but you definitely feel wiser and closer to enlightenment.

After you've confirmed that you're still on the same plane of existence as you
were before you walked in, head WEST to exit the office.",

You rub your eyes and sit up straight. Prof. Clarkson is looking at you with
concern in his eyes. Looks like you fell asleep somehow. \"Sorry,\" you yawn in
response.

\"It's okay, I just wanted to make sure you were fine. I know that 3110 takes a
lot out of you guys.\"

You nod groggily. Your bag feels a little bit heavier and your brain feels a
little bit brighter. \"You've given me a lot of ideas to think about,\" you tell
him, \"Thanks.\"

Prof. Clarkson flashes a smile at you and then swivels back to his computer.
Take a minute to process everything you've experienced and then head out through
the door toward the WEST.
